# Deadly Duck

Deady Duck is a video game in which the user controls a duck through four different game levels. The objective of the game is to make it through each successive level while picking up coins, health points, and ammo while shooting enemy ducks. Direct contact with enemy ducks will reduce health points and zero health points results in the game ending. To make it through each level, the player must find the magic portal that will transport them to the next stage. If the player is able to make it through the boss level and defeat the boss enemy duck, then the player wins the game.
